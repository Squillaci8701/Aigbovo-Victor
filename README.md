[Brief Introduction]

As a Cyber Governance Metrics and Resolution Analyst Intern at Summit Systems ISSP, I aim to safeguard digital assets by reducing third-party security risks and enhancing threat response capabilities. My competencies in cybersecurity incident response and using the NIST CSF guidelines have been instrumental in decreasing third-party security vulnerabilities by 30% and improving our organization's threat response by 25%.

The organization benefits from my dedication to developing and updating information security policies and my research into emerging threats, which aligns with my certified knowledge in cyber security risk. My proactive approach and analytical skills ensure robust defense mechanisms are in place, reflecting my commitment to continuous improvement and excellence in cybersecurity.

## Objective 

I am eager to apply analytical and problem-solving skills to support a cybersecurity GRC team in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks, with a particular interest in data privacy and compliance.
